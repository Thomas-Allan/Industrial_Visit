Introduction:
As an engineering student, I recently had the opportunity to visit the Kerala Agro Machinery Corporations Limited (KAMCO) in Palakkad. KAMCO is a government-owned company that specializes in the manufacture and sale of agricultural machinery and equipment. The visit was an insightful experience that provided me with a glimpse of the manufacturing process of agricultural machinery and their applications.

During the visit, we were given a brief overview of the company's history and its products. We were then taken on a tour of the manufacturing plant, where we saw the various stages of the manufacturing process of power tillers. The plant had a well-organized layout and was equipped with modern machinery.

The manufacturing process began with the fabrication of the chassis and other structural components using CNC machines. The components were then sent to the painting unit, where they were painted with a primer and topcoat. The engine and other parts were then assembled on the chassis, and the power tiller was subjected to various tests to ensure its quality and performance.

We also had the opportunity to see the testing of the power tillers in the field, where we saw the various functions of the machine in action. The power tiller was capable of performing various functions such as plowing, tilling, weeding, and pumping water. We were impressed with the performance of the machine and its versatility.
